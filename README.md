Pause All Azure SQL Datawarehouses
==================================

            

This Azure PowerShell Workflow Runbook uses a credential to login and looks for all Azure SQL Datawarehouses within a subscription that are not paused.  If it finds any Azure SQL Datawarehouses that are not paused, it pauses them. 
 It can be scheduled to run at a specific time to ensure all of your SQL Datawarehouses are paused.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
